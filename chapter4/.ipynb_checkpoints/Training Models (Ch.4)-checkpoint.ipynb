    "Most of the topics discussed in this chapter will be essential in understanding, building, and training neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will start by looking at the Linear Regression model, one of the simplest models there is. We will discuss two very different ways to train it:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Using a direct “closed-form” equation that directly computes the model parameters that best fit the model to the training set.\n",
    "- Using an iterative optimization approach, Gradient Descent (GD), that gradually tweaks the model parameters to minimize the cost function over the training set, eventually converging to the same set of parameters as the first method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next we will look at Polynomial Regression, a more complex model that can fit non‐ linear datasets. Since this model has more parameters than Linear Regression, it is more prone to overfitting the training data, so we will look at how to detect whether or not this is the case, using learning curves, and then we will look at several regulari‐ zation techniques that can reduce the risk of overfitting the training set.\n",
    "Finally, we will look at two more models that are commonly used for classification tasks: Logistic Regression and Softmax Regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 1. Linear Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "A linear model makes a prediction by simply computing a weighted sum of the input features, plus a constant called the bias term (also called the intercept term).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Predicted value = bias + weighted_input_feat_1 + weighted_input_feat_2 + ... + weighted_input_feat_n\n",
    "\n",
    "Training a model means setting its parameters so that the model best fits the training set. For this purpose, we first need a measure of how well (or poorly) the model fits the training data. The most common performance measure of a regression model is the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). Therefore, to train a Linear Regression model, you need to find the value of θ (weights) that minimizes the RMSE.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### The normal equation\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a closed-form solution to find the value of θ that minimizes the cost function, called the Normal Equation.\n",
    "- θ=(XTX)^−1 XT y\n"

    "##### 2. Gradient descent\n",
    "\n",
    "The general idea of Gradient Descent is to tweak parameters iteratively in order to minimize a cost function. It measures the local gradient of the error function with regards to the parameter vector θ, and it goes in the direction of descending gradient. Once the gradient is zero, we have reached a minimum.\n",
    "\n",
    "Concretely, we start by filling θ with random values (random initialization), and then we improve it gradually, taking one baby step at a time, each step attempting to decrease the cost function (e.g., the MSE), until the algorithm converges to a minimum.\n",
    "\n",
    "An important parameter in Gradient Descent is the size of the steps, determined by the learning rate hyperparameter. If the learning rate is too small, then the algorithm will have to go through many iterations to converge, which will take a long time. On the other hand, if the learning rate is too high, you might jump across the valley and end up on the other side, possibly even higher up than you were before. This might make the algorithm diverge, with larger and larger values, failing to find a good solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, not all cost functions look like nice regular bowls. There may be holes, ridges, plateaus, and all sorts of irregular terrains, making convergence to the minimum very difficult.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, the MSE cost function for a Linear Regression model happens to be a convex function, which means that if we pick any two points on the curve, the line segment joining them never crosses the curve. This implies that there are no local minima, just one global minimum.\n",
    "\n",
    "Training a model means searching for a combination of model parameters that minimizes a cost function (over the training set). It is a search in the model’s parameter space: the more parameters a model has, the more dimensions this space has, and the harder the search is: searching for a needle in a 300-dimensional haystack is much trickier than in three dimensions."

Batch GD uses the whole batch of training data at every step (actually, Full Gradient Descent would probably be a better name). As a result it is terribly slow on very large training sets. However, Gradient Descent scales well with the number of features; training a Linear Regression model when there are hundreds of thousands of features is much faster using Gradient Descent than using the Normal Equation or SVD decomposition."

It also makes it possible to train on huge training sets, since only one instance needs to be in memory at each iteration.\n",

    "##### 4. Regularized linear models\n",
    "\n",
    "A good way to reduce overfitting is to regularize the model (i.e., to constrain it). For a linear model, regularization is tipically achieved by constraining the weights of the model. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Ridge regression\n",
    "\n",
    "Where a regularization term equal to α∑n θ 2 is added to the cost function. This forces the learning algorithm to not only fit the data but also keep the model weights as small as possible. Note that the regularization term should only be added to the cost function during training. Once the model is trained, we'll want to evaluate the model’s performance using the unregularized performance measure.\n",
    "\n",
    "The hyperparameter α controls how much you want to regularize the model. If α = 0 then Ridge Regression is just Linear Regression. If α is very large, then all weights end up very close to zero and the result is a flat line going through the data’s mean."

When r = 0, Elastic Net is equivalent to Ridge Regression, and when r = 1, it is equivalent to Lasso Regression.\n",

    "When should we use plain Linear Regression (i.e., without any regularization), Ridge, Lasso, or Elastic Net? It is almost always preferable to have at least a little bit of regularization, so generally you should avoid plain Linear Regression. Ridge is a good default, but if you suspect that only a few features are actually useful, you should pre‐ fer Lasso or Elastic Net since they tend to reduce the useless features’ weights down to zero as we have discussed. In general, Elastic Net is preferred over Lasso since Lasso may behave erratically when the number of features is greater than the number of training instances or when several features are strongly correlated."

    "Logistic Regression is commonly used to estimate the probability that an instance belongs to a particular class. If the estimated probability is greater than 50%, then the model predicts that the instance belongs to that class (called the positive class, labeled “1”), or else it predicts that it does not (i.e., it belongs to the negative class, labeled “0”). This makes it a binary classifier.\n",

The cost function over the whole training set is simply the average cost over all training instances. It can be written in a single expression (as you can verify easily), called the log loss.\n",
